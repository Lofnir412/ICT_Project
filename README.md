Top-Down Shooter

A small, self-contained HTML5 canvas shooter. Realistic-feel visuals, easy early waves, enemies, collisions, and a live health bar.

Run
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). No build step.

Controls
- WASD: Move
- Mouse: Aim
- Mouse Hold: Shoot
- Shift: Sprint
- R: Restart after game over

Notes
- Difficulty ramps every ~15 seconds via waves. Enemies speed/health increase and spawn more frequently.
- Health bar at the top centers and shrinks as you take damage.
- Performance tips: close unused tabs; disable heavy extensions.

Files
- `index.html`: DOM and UI
- `styles.css`: UI styling
- `main.js`: Game loop, entities, AI, collisions, rendering

Enjoy!
